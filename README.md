# Portfolio


Welcome to my portfolio, this is my first complete portfolio that I plan to keep updating and adding projects to as I gain more skills. 
My Name is Dale Allen, and I am a web developer in progress trying to lean all the fundementals and new languages to help me grow my career.
This portfolio contains my about me, link to resume and needed website links, and my personal projects I have been building.

This project was made with HTML, bootstrap for buttons and CSS.
